    title: `Why, modern web development should go back to its roots again. To MPA.`,
    synopsis: `In today’s web development world, Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) are two of the most common approaches for building websites and apps. Both have their advantages, but SPAs, while popular due to their smooth user experience, come with some significant drawbacks when compared to traditional MPAs. In this post, we’ll delve into why SPAs can be worse than MPAs, highlighting issues around performance, SEO, user experience, and development complexity.`,

      `In today’s web development world, Single Page Applications (SPAs) and Multi-Page Applications (MPAs) are two of the most common approaches for building websites and apps. Both have their advantages, but SPAs, while popular due to their smooth user experience, come with some significant drawbacks when compared to traditional MPAs. In this post, we’ll delve into why SPAs can be worse than MPAs, highlighting issues around performance, SEO, user experience, and development complexity.`,
      `##The Performance Pitfall##`,
      `One of the key selling points of SPAs is that they offer a seamless experience. Once the initial page is loaded, content is updated dynamically, often without refreshing the entire page. However, this dynamic approach can lead to serious performance problems, especially as the application grows in complexity.`,
      `When a user first loads a SPA, the browser needs to download a large JavaScript bundle. Depending on the size of this bundle, this initial load can be slow, leading to a poor first impression. In an MPA, each page is typically loaded with its own resources, meaning that users can start interacting with the website almost immediately, while the rest of the content loads in the background. In contrast, SPAs tend to rely on a hefty initial load, which can be frustrating, especially in regions with slow internet connections or on mobile devices.`,
      `The constant loading of resources as users navigate between different sections of the application can also lead to jarring experiences. MPAs, on the other hand, handle these transitions more smoothly by refreshing only the parts of the page that need updating, making them more reliable in terms of performance.`,
      `##SEO Struggles##`,
      `Another critical downside to SPAs is how they handle search engine optimization (SEO). In SPAs, content is often loaded dynamically via JavaScript, meaning the actual HTML served to search engine crawlers might be quite bare-bones. This makes it difficult for search engines to index the site properly, resulting in poor visibility in search results. Even though there are workarounds—like server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering—these solutions add layers of complexity and can’t fully replicate the SEO-friendliness of MPAs.`,
      `MPAs, in contrast, are inherently better suited for SEO. Since each page is a distinct URL, search engines can easily crawl, index, and rank individual pages. Content is already rendered on the server, so there’s no need for complicated workarounds to make sure search engines can read it. For websites that rely heavily on organic traffic, the inability to properly optimize a SPA can be a dealbreaker.`,
      `##Increased Complexity and Development Time##`,
      `While SPAs can offer smooth, app-like experiences, they come with a higher level of development complexity. To create a truly responsive and efficient SPA, developers often need to use JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.js. These frameworks have steep learning curves, and the architecture required to manage state, handle routing, and ensure smooth client-side navigation can be complex and time-consuming.`,
      `On the other hand, MPAs are often more straightforward to develop. They follow a traditional approach where each page is handled as a separate entity. Since each page is independent, developers don’t have to worry as much about client-side routing, state management, or managing complex interactions between different sections of the app. While MPAs still require good web development practices, they typically demand less specialized knowledge compared to SPAs.`,
      `Moreover, SPAs require extensive testing and maintenance to ensure that everything works seamlessly across different browsers and devices. Debugging client-side issues can be tricky, and optimizing performance is an ongoing battle, especially as the app scales. MPAs, by contrast, tend to be simpler to debug because each page can be tested independently, and they don’t require the same level of continuous optimization for client-side performance.`,
      `##User Experience: The Flip Side##`,
      `While SPAs are often lauded for providing a smooth, app-like experience, there are instances where this can actually backfire. Since the content is dynamically loaded, the browser’s back and forward buttons don’t always behave as expected. This can confuse users, especially if they try to navigate to a previous page or share a specific page link. In a traditional MPA, each page has its own unique URL, making navigation intuitive and predictable.`,
      `In SPAs, developers must carefully manage the browser history to ensure that users can easily move back and forth through the app. While this is achievable, it requires a level of attention to detail that might be unnecessary in an MPA, where page transitions happen naturally. The lack of clear page reloads in SPAs can also make it harder for users to know where they are within the app, diminishing the overall user experience.`,
      `##Security Concerns##`,
      `SPAs, because they load content dynamically and handle a significant amount of logic on the client side, often expose more data to the browser than MPAs do. While this might not be a huge problem for every type of application, it increases the risk of exposing sensitive data or providing hackers with more information than they would get from a traditional server-rendered page. Additionally, SPAs are more prone to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, as they often rely heavily on JavaScript to render and manage content.`,
      `MPAs, in contrast, generally don’t rely as much on client-side logic and often serve more data from the server, which can be more tightly controlled. The server renders the content, meaning less data is exposed to the client, and security measures can be more easily implemented at the server level.`,
      `##Conclusion##`,
      `While Single Page Applications may seem like the future of web development, especially with their smooth, app-like experiences, they come with a host of challenges that make them less ideal for certain use cases. SPAs can struggle with performance, especially on slower networks; they face significant SEO hurdles; they require more complex development processes; and they can create confusing user experiences with unpredictable navigation. In contrast, Multi-Page Applications offer a simpler, more secure, and SEO-friendly alternative, making them a better choice for many websites, especially those where performance, accessibility, and SEO are critical.`,
      `Of course, every project is unique, and the choice between a SPA and an MPA should be driven by the specific needs of the website or app. However, for those who prioritize speed, SEO, and ease of development, MPAs may still have the upper hand.`,
